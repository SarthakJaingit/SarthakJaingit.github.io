I'm an 11th grader passionate about Agtech, GANs, and Fencing: Currently working as only [high school intern](https://schaterji.io/team/sarthak-jain.html) in Innovatory for Cells and Neural Machines Lab of Purdue, started and currently running AI and Computer Vision Club at the Phillipines Science High School, published in Journal of American Heart Associatiation, and  Skills: Python (Pytorch, OpenCV, numpy etc.), Swift, B2021 + Nationally Ranked Fencer.

Indepedently, I am currently working on building a Farming Autonomous Rover called FAR. I am recording my progress in a [blog series](https://sarthakj.substack.com/)


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
